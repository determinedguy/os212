## Week 00

1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
This is one of my video recommendations to understand the fundamental of operating systems.
The presenter explains this technical topic into a fun and interesting one in a very short time.
What I like from this video is the hardware side of operating system is explained too, so the audience can understand operating system from software and hardware side.

2. [What is an Operating System as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
This is one of my video recommendations to understand about operating system as fast as possible, especially if you like Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips (hehe).
Linus (as always) puts puns and jokes to make the video enjoyable to watch and understand.
If you don't really like cartoon animation, this video might be more suitable for you.

3. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU)<br>
This video is my last recommendations to understand about operating system.
This video is full of animations (no face or person shown), so this video is suitable if you like flashy animations instead of boring lecture.

4. [Introduction to Linux Operating System (OS): What is Linux?](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html)<br>
This article explains about Linux (and a bit review of operating system).
The article explains about the history of Linux, the purpose of Linux as an operating system, and the benefits of using Linux.
I think this is a great article for beginners who don't really understand Linux or who don't know anything about Linux.

## Week 01

1. [What is a Virtual Machine?](https://blog.stackpath.com/virtual-machine/)<br>
This article is a good introduction about virtualization and virtual machine, since those topics are essential for this course.
If you don't know about them and want to learn about them, this article is a good start for you. 

2. [Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners)<br>
This article is a good start for you who are just starting to learn about bash scripting.
Bash scripting is an essential skill that must be known by Linux users (or mastered, if you're a real hardcore one).
I highly recommend this article, as it includes short videos to explain each commands interactively.

3. [Awk Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/index.htm)<br>
This tutorial takes you through AWK, one of the most prominent text-processing utility on GNU/Linux.
This tutorial covers topics about an overview of AWK, its environment, and workflow, the tutorial proceeds to explain the syntax, variables, operators, arrays, loops, and functions used in AWK.
It also covers topics such as output redirection and pretty printing.

4. [Sed and Awk 101 Hacks](https://vds-admin.ru/sed-and-awk-101-hacks)<br>
Sed and Awk are two great utilities that can solve a lot of complex tasks quickly with only a few lines of code.
If you're still learning about Sed and Awk, this is a great resource for you to master them.

5. [Nano Or Vim? Which Terminal Text Editor Should You Use?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAwo7CLWlUc)<br>
This video is a good video for comparing between two popular terminal text editors, vim and nano.
If you're confused to choose which one suits for your needs, this video might be a good material to help you make the decision.

6. [Nano Editor Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyKiDczLIZ4)<br>
This video explain the fundamentals of nano, the terminal text editor I use on this course.
I highly recommend this video since I often revisit this video if I forget some things about nano.
If you're using nano text editor like me, this video is definitely useful for you!

## Week 02

1. [Fundamentals of C Programming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342640273_Fundamentals_of_C_Programming)<br>
This presentation explain technical fundamentals of C language.
Even though we learned Java and Java is closely similar in syntax, we still need to learn about C language to understand this course better.
If you want to understand well about fundamentals of C, I recommend this presentation as your first step of entering the world of C.
A bit fun fact (if you haven't known about this); Linux is made of C language!

2. [GNU Privacy Guard](https://lms.onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/GNU_Privacy_Guard)<br>
This article explains about GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), a tool that is used to crypt files in this course.
I'm glad I find this article as it is type in Indonesian!
If you want to learn more about GnuPG (instead of "just" following the guide without knowing about GnuPG), this article is a good headstart for you.

3. [Cyber Security In 7 Minutes | What Is Cyber Security: How It Works? | Cyber Security | Simplilearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inWWhr5tnEA)<br>
This video explains a brief introduction about cybersecurity (a.k.a. cyber security, just a different styling).
Some of attack techniques (such as malware, phishing, DDoS, and SQL injection) are explained here.
If you like video with visual elements (such as cartoon), this video is suitable for you.

4. [Cybersecurity: Crash Course Computer Science #31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPVaOlJ6ln0)<br>
This video explains a briefer (but longer) introduction about cybersecurity (prior to the previous video).
This video combines visual animations with small lectures to deliver the lesson.
If you like a briefer introduction, I recommend this video to watch.

## Week 03

1. [FUSE - The Linux Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/fuse.html)<br>
This article is a good starter to understand FUSE, the Linux filesystem.
The article explains the important definitions and commands well to understand FUSE.
There are also some explanation on the kernel side.
This is a good comprehensed article, I recommend this if you have some basics of Linux and filesystem.

2. [Tutorial FUSE pada Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utkwg9Mwtsg)<br>
This video is a good tutorial if you need practice on understanding FUSE.
I think this video is a good guidance since we are supposed to practice the demos by our own.
Since this video is explained in Indonesian, I highly recommend this video if you have desire to fully understand about FUSE.

3. [Linux File Hierarchy Structure - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-hierarchy-structure/)<br>
