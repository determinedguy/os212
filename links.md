This is one of my video recommendations to understand the fundamental of operating systems.
The presenter explains this technical topic into a fun and interesting one in a very short time.
What I like from this video is the hardware side of operating system is explained too, so the audience can understand operating system from software and hardware side.

2. [What is an Operating System as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
This is one of my video recommendations to understand about operating system as fast as possible, especially if you like Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips (hehe).
Linus (as always) puts puns and jokes to make the video enjoyable to watch and understand.
If you don't really like cartoon animation, this video might be more suitable for you.

3. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU)<br>

If you want to understand well about fundamentals of C, I recommend this presentation as your first step of entering the world of C.
<br>
A bit fun fact (if you haven't known about this); Linux is made of C language!

2. [GNU Privacy Guard](https://lms.onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/GNU_Privacy_Guard)<br>
This article explains about GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), a tool that is used to crypt files in this course.

I dare you to read this article, hehe.

3. [Pointers in C++](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~rkm010300/utd/cs3376/ppt/ch09.pdf)<br>
Even though this slide presentation is intended for C++, I think it is still providing a good basic for understanding pointers in C.
C++ is a programming language which is an extension of the C programming language; that is why most of concepts of C++ is still appicable for C, even though it might have different syntax.
This slide has a comprehensive explanation about pointers.
It even has some basic visualization to help you out!
I highly recommend this slide if you want to comprehend the basics of pointer in C.
