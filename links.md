## Week 00

1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
This is one of my video recommendations to understand the fundamental of operating systems.
The presenter explains this technical topic into a fun and interesting one in a very short time.
What I like from this video is the hardware side of operating system is explained too, so the audience can understand operating system from software and hardware side.

2. [What is an Operating System as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
This is one of my video recommendations to understand about operating system as fast as possible, especially if you like Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips (hehe).
Linus (as always) puts puns and jokes to make the video enjoyable to watch and understand.
If you don't really like cartoon animation, this video might be more suitable for you.

3. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU)<br>
This video is my last recommendations to understand about operating system.
This video is full of animations (no face or person shown), so this video is suitable if you like flashy animations instead of boring lecture.

4. [Introduction to Linux Operating System (OS): What is Linux?](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html)<br>
This article explains about Linux (and a bit review of operating system).
The article explains about the history of Linux, the purpose of Linux as an operating system, and the benefits of using Linux.
I think this is a great article for beginners who don't really understand Linux or who don't know anything about Linux.

## Week 01

5. [Nano Or Vim? Which Terminal Text Editor Should You Use?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAwo7CLWlUc)<br>
This video is a good video for comparing between two popular terminal text editors, vim and nano.
If you're confused to choose which one suits for your needs, this video might be a good material to help you make the decision.
