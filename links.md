This is one of my video recommendations to understand the fundamental of operating systems.
The presenter explains this technical topic into a fun and interesting one in a very short time.
What I like from this video is the hardware side of operating system is explained too, so the audience can understand operating system from software and hardware side.

2. [What is an Operating System as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzRTmdd9j0)<br>
This is one of my video recommendations to understand about operating system as fast as possible, especially if you like Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips (hehe).
Linus (as always) puts puns and jokes to make the video enjoyable to watch and understand.
If you don't really like cartoon animation, this video might be more suitable for you.

3. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU)<br>
This video is my last recommendations to understand about operating system.
This video is full of animations (no face or person shown), so this video is suitable if you like flashy animations instead of boring lecture.

4. [Introduction to Linux Operating System (OS): What is Linux?](https://www.guru99.com/introduction-linux.html)<br>
This article explains about Linux (and a bit review of operating system).

Even though we learned Java and Java is closely similar in syntax, we still need to learn about C language to understand this course better.
If you want to understand well about fundamentals of C, I recommend this presentation as your first step of entering the world of C.
<br>
A bit fun fact (if you haven't known about this); Linux is made of C language!

2. [GNU Privacy Guard](https://lms.onnocenter.or.id/wiki/index.php/GNU_Privacy_Guard)<br>
This article explains about GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG), a tool that is used to crypt files in this course.
I'm glad I find this article as it is type in Indonesian!
If you want to learn more about GnuPG (instead of "just" following the guide without knowing about GnuPG), this article is a good headstart for you.

3. [Cyber Security In 7 Minutes | What Is Cyber Security: How It Works? | Cyber Security | Simplilearn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inWWhr5tnEA)<br>
This video explains a brief introduction about cybersecurity (a.k.a. cyber security, just a different styling).
Some of attack techniques (such as malware, phishing, DDoS, and SQL injection) are explained here.
If you like video with visual elements (such as cartoon), this video is suitable for you.

4. [Cybersecurity: Crash Course Computer Science #31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPVaOlJ6ln0)<br>

2. [Tutorial FUSE pada Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utkwg9Mwtsg)<br>
This video is a good tutorial if you need practice on understanding FUSE.
I think this video is a good guidance since we are supposed to practice the demos by our own.
Since this video is explained in Indonesian, I highly recommend this video if you have desire to fully understand about FUSE.

3. [Linux File Hierarchy Structure - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-hierarchy-structure/)<br>

This article explains a good explanation about how static and dynamic libraries works in Linux.
"You came to the right place if you’re wondering how static and dynamic libraries work in C programs," the writer writes.
The article even has some video resources as a supplement for you.
I recommend this article if you want to understand deeply about libraries in Linux and C (since, you know, Linux is made of C language).
<br>
P.S. I kind of hate Medium as it limits us as a non-member to read articles in a restricted amount.

2. [What is memory mapping in Linux?](https://ostoday.org/linux/what-is-memory-mapping-in-linux.html)<br>
This article explains a brief yet comprehensive explanation about memory mapping in Linux.
Memory mapping is one of the most interesting features of a Unix system, so I highly recommend you to push your limits on learning memory mapping.

I dare you to read this article, hehe.

3. [Pointers in C++](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~rkm010300/utd/cs3376/ppt/ch09.pdf)<br>
Even though this slide presentation is intended for C++, I think it is still providing a good basic for understanding pointers in C.
C++ is a programming language which is an extension of the C programming language; that is why most of concepts of C++ is still appicable for C, even though it might have different syntax.
This slide has a comprehensive explanation about pointers.
It even has some basic visualization to help you out!
I highly recommend this slide if you want to comprehend the basics of pointer in C.

"What is caching? and "how does a cache work?" are common questions in computing.
This article gives you a brief explanation about cache and how does a cache work.
Even though this article is oriented to web caching, the concept is still applicable generally to anything related to caching.
Since we are studying about platform-based programming at the same time, this article might be helpful for you. 

3. [Memory Allocation](https://www.cs.uah.edu/~rcoleman/Common/C_Reference/MemoryAlloc.html)<br>
This college course material explains about memory allocation briefly.

I highly recommend this article to those who don't understand the basics of fork().

## Week 07

1. [Process Synchronisation and Deadlocks](https://computing.dcu.ie/~humphrys/Notes/OS/synch.html)<br>
This website... has an old-school style.
But it doesn't keep itself from giving useful informations! ;)<br>
Even though it has a little amount of text explanations, but it has useful visualizations to explain the concepts of process synchronisation and deadlocks!
There are some excerpt C codes to give practical examples of them.
If you like visualization more than texts, I recommend this website as a companion to the materials.
