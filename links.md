1. [Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26QPDBe-NB8)<br>
This is one of my video recommendations to understand the fundamental of operating systems.
The presenter explains this technical topic into a fun and interesting one in a very short time.
What I like from this video is the hardware side of operating system is explained too, so the audience can understand operating system from software and hardware side.
