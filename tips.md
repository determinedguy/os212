# TIPS

1. **Berysukurlah.**<br>
Why do we have to be grateful?<br>
Of course we have to be grateful because we have the opportunity to study about operating system, duh!<br>
*Alhamdulillah.*

2. **Try to explore the kinds of operating system.**<br>
You might only know about Windows and Mac OS.<br>
What about Linux? What about Android? What about FreeBSD? What about iOS? What about Tizen? What about KaiOS?<br>
Just try to open your curiosity about operating system in general, I'm sure you won't regret it.

3. **Try to indulge in C programming language.**<br>
In case you don't know, most of operating system is constructed by using C language.<br>
Well, you might want to complete your learning journey in Java (yes, I'm talking about DDP2) before learning C.<br>
I promise it's not that different; but still, just try to learn it a bit if you don't want to cry over the demos.

4. **BE PUNCTUAL!**<br>
No, I'm not kidding this time.<br>
Make sure you're keeping yourself updated with informations and forums.<br>
(And yes, do it **manually**; don't even think to make a program to refresh and fetch the forums for this case.)<br>
Be punctual if you don't want to cry while hoping to have an exciting journey in this course.

5. **Improve your Googling skills.**<br>
In this course, you will learn the "**GSGS**" term (stands for "**Google Sana, Google Sini**").<br>
Please improve your Googling skill if you want to ace in your assignments and quizzes.<br>
Yes, asking your teaching assistants is a magnificent solution, but (oh boy!) you'll be pushed to be independent in this course.<br>
Do this tips if you want to ace this course.

6. **Get your hands _dirty_.**<br>
Do DEMOS if you really want to take benefits of learning operating system.<br>
Most of students don't understand the purpose of this course (and complain, in some cases), yet they never practice the demos.<br>
Just do not forget to **backup** just in case you might screw up your setup.
