# TIPS

1. **Berysukurlah.**
Why do we have to be grateful?<br>
Of course we have to be grateful because we have the opportunity to study about operating system, duh!<br>
*Alhamdulillah.*

2. **Try to explore the kinds of operating system.**
You might only know about Windows and Mac OS.<br>
What about Linux? What about Android? What about FreeBSD? What about iOS? What about Tizen? What about KaiOS?<br>
Just try to open your curiosity about operating system in general, I'm sure you won't regret it.

3. **Try to indulge in C programming language.**
In case you don't know, most of operating system is constructed by using C language.<br>
Well, you might want to complete your learning journey in Java (yes, I'm talking about DDP2) before learning C.<br>
I promise it's not that different; but still, just try to learn it a bit if you don't want to cry over the demos.

4. **BE PUNCTUAL!**
No, I'm not kidding this time.<br>
Make sure you're keeping yourself updated with informations and forums (and yes, do it manually; don't even think to make a refresher and fetcher for this case.)<br>
Please be punctual if you don't want to cry while having an exciting journey in this course.
